# SweetMoney
 SweetMoney is a personal finance app for your family.

It is based on Django and uses a SQLite database (for now) to organize your expenses.
This app is made to turn your financial flow easy and simple to track, organizing it by "expense groups" (or Flow Groups), with a user based organization.
You will have 3 different user categories:
- Administrator: Who can do everything and see everything
- Member / Parent: Who can create new expense groups, edit and add expenses, incomes and investments.
- Children: Can only take care of their own expense group.

More details soon...
